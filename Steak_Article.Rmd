### First chunk of code
## Document setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# define knitr options
# these have all been set to FALSE to produce a cleaner final document, set to TRUE while debugging
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)

# set any missing NAs in table to blank (makes nicer tables)
options(knitr.kable.NA='')

# load R packages (list all of them here to make it easier for users to know which packages to install)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggthemes)

# load dataset
data("steak_survey", package="fivethirtyeight")

# create subset, no missing NAs (create all objects needed in document)
# pick a specific region
sdat <- na.omit(steak_survey) %>%
  filter(region=="Mountain")

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
